# Project-2

This project is a game that I have been working on. It is a WWII themed bullethell shooter game. You control a fighter plane flying over the ocean and fighting various enemy aircraft. You fire a machine gun witht the space bar and can move around the screen to line up your shots or dodge ocnoming fire.

The goal of the game is to make it to the end and take on the final boss which is a rail cannon with more health than other enemies and a powerful attack that can take you out in one hit. I have included many different sound effects in the game for various explosions and engine noises.
